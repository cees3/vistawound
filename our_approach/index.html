            <span>Our Story</span>
            <h3>Tulsa Wound Care, Built on Experience !</h3>
            <p>
              Vista Wound Specialists was founded by two physicians who saw a
              gap - and an opportunity - in the way wound care was delivered.
            </p>
            <p>
              One, an experienced Emergency Medicine physician, had spent years
              treating complex wounds in high-stakes environments. The other, a
              specialist in Occupational and Preventive Medicine, had worked to
              improve health outcomes across diverse populations. Both are
              board-certified in wound care, bringing advanced training and a
              commitment to evidence-based practice to every patient encounter.
            </p>
            <p>
              Together, they shared a common frustration: too many patients were
              falling through the cracks, struggling to access consistent,
              high-quality wound care, especially those with mobility issues or
              in rural settings.
            </p>
            <p>So, they built something better.</p>
            <p>
              Vista Wound Specialists was born from a vision to bring advanced,
              evidence-based, and accessible wound care directly to the people
              who need it most. At the heart of our practice is a belief that
              every patient deserves expert care, delivered with compassion,
              professionalism, and unwavering integrity. By going to the patient
              in the home, assisted living, or skilled nursing facility, we
              eliminate barriers and elevate outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              We don’t just manage wounds. We change lives by meeting patients
              where they are, communicating clearly with care teams, and
              following through with excellence every step of the way.
