## 🚑 A Proactive Approach to Reducing Hospital Readmissions

A key metric for every case manager is the 30-day readmission rate. Non-healing wounds are a primary driver of avoidable ER visits and hospitalizations due to infection or deterioration. Our service directly addresses this challenge.

By providing **expert wound care in the home or skilled nursing facility,** we intervene before a problem escalates. Our licensed providers assess, treat, and monitor wounds closely, managing early complications and preventing the infections that often lead to readmission.

> 🧠 _For case managers in the Tulsa area, partnering with Vista means adding a crucial layer of post-discharge support that directly impacts your quality metrics._
