💡 Home health nurses are the backbone of community care in Northeast Oklahoma. Every day, you navigate complex patient needs, endless charting, and the logistical challenges of providing high-quality care in the home. You are a skilled clinician, a patient advocate, and a master coordinator. We know that managing complex wounds and **preventing hospital readmissions** can add significant strain to your already demanding workload.

At Vista Wound Specialists, we don’t just see a wound; we see the entire picture. We see you, the dedicated nurse managing the patient’s overall care plan, and our entire **mobile wound care** model is built to support you. This is what we mean when we say we work alongside you, not over you. 🤝

## 📋 Clear Communication & Prompt Documentation

We’ve heard the stories from nurses across the Tulsa area:
🧾 You send a referral to a specialist and the chart notes never come back.  
📞 You play endless phone tag trying to get an update.

Our approach is designed to eliminate that frustration and **streamline your workflow**.

We consider _you_, the home health nurse, to be our primary partner in the patient’s success. This includes:

✅ **Direct & Timely Updates**  
We provide clear, concise updates after our visits. You will know the findings, the treatment plan, and the next steps.

✅ **Prompt Documentation**  
We understand the importance of timely charting. Our providers complete and share documentation promptly, **reducing your charting time** so you have what you need to close your notes without delay.

✅ **True Care Plan Integration:**  
We’re not here to dictate a new plan; we’re here to add a specialized component to yours. We review your existing plan and build upon it, ensuring our interventions are perfectly aligned with the patient's overall goals.

## 🛏️ Advanced Bedside Procedures to Simplify Patient Care

🔹 [Bedside debridement](/help/)  
🔹 Application of [advanced dressings and biologics](/help/)  
🔹 [Skin substitute grafting](/help/)  
🔹 [Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) management](/help/)

By bringing these services to the home, we not only provide expert care without delay but also free you from the burden of arranging transport and appointments.
